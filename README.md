# Welcome to my Data Science & Analytics Portfolio
This repository contains projects that I worked on during Wisconsin-Madison's Data Science & Analytics Bootcamp
Below you will find a list of the projects with a brief discription about each one and a link that will take you to the project notebook code or visualization 


## Data Wrangling
**Description and Notebook:**
> This project was the final assignment from Data Wrangling course
The notebook contains all the details about the project goal and requirements, you can find a link to the notebook [here.](https://github.com/kaialali/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Khalifa_Al_Ali_Data_Wrangling_Hotel_Project.ipynb)

## Business Intelligence
**Description:** 
> This project was the final assignment from Business Intelligence course, the rquirement was to create a dashboard using one of the datasets provided to us.

**Data Source:** 
> I picked a dataset that includes information about every live-action Marvel or DC film released between 1944â€“2020. The data set contains 19 columns and nearly 90 rows. The data set and descriptions of the column names can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jcraggy/marvel-vs-dc-imdb-rotten-tomatoes)
The goal is to create a dashboard that allows users to compare Marvel vs. DC superhero films.

**Dashbaord:**
> The most challenging part in this dashboard was the 'Select Genre' filter, which took me some time to figure out how to create it given that each movie belonged to multiple genres.
You can find the dashboard [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/khalifa.al.ali/viz/Marvelvs_DC_16550871428330/Dashboard1#1)

## SQL and Advanced SQL
**Description:**
> In this bootcamp we had a "SQL & databases" and "Advanced SQL Programming, by the end of each course we had practical exams that allowed us to demonstrate the skills we learned during class.

**SQL & Databases:**
> You can find the final exams answers I submitted [here.](https://github.com/kaialali/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Khalifa_AlAli%20Fina%20Project%20Answers.pdf)

**Advanced SQL Programming**
> You can find the final exams answers I submitted [here.](https://github.com/kaialali/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Khalifa.pdf)

## Machine Learning
**Description and Notebook:**
> The final project in the Machine Learning course # Machine Learning: Final Project. The challenge was to build the most accurate model for predicting which passangers would survive the sinking of the Titanic using Titanic dataset found [here.]() 
> We used two different models for our prediction then evaluate which one is the best. You can find the work done in the nootbook [here.]()
