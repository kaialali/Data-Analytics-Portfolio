# Welcome to my Data Science & Analytics Portfolio
This repository contains projects that I worked on during Wisconsin-Madison's Data Science & Analytics Bootcamp
Below you will find a list of the projects with a brief discription about each one and a link that will take you to the project notebook code or visualization

# Business Intelligence Project
## Description: 
This project was the final assignment from Business Intelligence course, the rquirement was to create a dashboard using one of the datasets provided to us.
## Data Source: 
I picked a dataset that includes information about every live-action Marvel or DC film released between 1944â€“2020. The data set contains 19 columns and nearly 90 rows. The data set and descriptions of the column names can be found here(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jcraggy/marvel-vs-dc-imdb-rotten-tomatoes)
The goal is to create a dashboard that allows users to compare Marvel vs. DC superhero films.
## Dashbaord link
The most challenging part in this dashboard was the 'Select Genre' filter, which took me some time to figure out how to create it given that each movie belonged to multiple genres.
You can find the dashboard here(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/khalifa.al.ali/viz/Marvelvs_DC_16550871428330/Dashboard1#1)
